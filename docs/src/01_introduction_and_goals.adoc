== Introduction and Goals

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider. 
These include

* underlying business goals, 
* essential features, 
* essential functional requirements, 
* quality goals for the architecture and
* relevant stakeholders and their expectations
****

The project that was proposed was implementing the game "gamey", all while mantaining a professional

workflow simulating real life situations, covering all the aspects that could happen, these include:

**  Backend development

**  Frontend development

**  Management of new API's and overcome difficulties with new software

**  Quality control

If all of these are followed correctly the resulting project should go according to the theory.

=== Requirements Overview

The game should be accessed in a web server, in which the player will be able to log in and save its results.

As for the game, a bot will be implemented with an algorithm according to the difficulty selected by the player,

so it should go from easy to hard.

.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
(with version number and information where to find it).

.Motivation
From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-1/[Introduction and Goals] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Quality Goals

[options="header",cols="1,2,3"]
|===
|Priority |Quality Goal |Scenario
| 1 | **Usability** | Players should be able to register, log in, and start a game against the bot in under 30 seconds without needing a manual.
| 2 | **Performance** | The bot's move calculation (latency) must be under 500ms, even on the "Hard" difficulty setting, to maintain game flow.
| 3 | **Maintainability** | New features or bot algorithms can be integrated within one work day without breaking the existing frontend or API contracts.
| 4 | **Reliability** | The system must ensure 99% data integrity, specifically that game results are never lost during a database save operation.
| 5 | **Security** | Only authenticated users can submit scores to their own profiles; the API must prevent "score spoofing" from external tools.

.Contents
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. 
We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals.
They are not necessarily identical.

Consider this overview of potential topics (based upon the ISO 25010 standard):

image::01_2_iso-25010-topics-EN.drawio.png["Categories of Quality Requirements"]

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. 
Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...

.Form
A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities

=== Stakeholders

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* should know the architecture
* have to be convinced of the architecture
* have to work with the architecture or with code
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.

|Role/Name|Contact|Expectations
| **Project Supervisor (Teacher)** | Teaching Staff | Expects a professional development workflow, clean and documented code, and fulfillment of all functional requirements (the bot and web server).
| **Development Team (Students)** | Student Group | Expect to learn new technologies (API management, Frontend/Backend), gain experience in professional workflows, and achieve a high grade.
| **End Users (Players)** | Web Access | Expect a functional and entertaining game, a challenging bot difficulty, and the ability to save their progress reliably.
| **Quality Assurance (QA)** | Internal Team | Expects the code to be testable and the game to be free of critical bugs before deployment.
