.Contents
The runtime view describes concrete behavior and interactions of the system’s building blocks in form of scenarios from the following areas:

* important use cases or features: how do building blocks execute them?
* interactions at critical external interfaces: how do building blocks cooperate with users and neighboring systems?
* operation and administration: launch, start-up, stop
* error and exception scenarios

Remark: The main criterion for the choice of possible scenarios (sequences, workflows) is their *architectural relevance*. It is *not* important to describe a large number of scenarios. You should rather document a representative selection.

.Motivation
You should understand how (instances of) building blocks of your system perform their job and communicate at runtime.
You will mainly capture scenarios in your documentation to communicate your architecture to stakeholders that are less willing or able to read and understand the static models (building block view, deployment view).

.Form
There are many notations for describing scenarios, e.g.

* numbered list of steps (in natural language)
* activity diagrams or flow charts
* sequence diagrams
* BPMN or EPCs (event process chains)
* state machines
* ...


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-6/[Runtime View] in the arc42 documentation.

endif::arc42help[]

The runtime view describes the behaviour and interactions of the system's building blocks through selected scenarios. It captures how the TypeScript Web Application and the Rust Module cooperate to fulfill the requirements.

=== User Registration and History Consultation

This scenario references the high-level requirement: _Users will be able to register and consult participation history._ 
It describes how a user interacts with the system to manage their profile and view their match history.

* _<insert sequence diagram of the scenario described>_

*1.* User provides registration details through the Web Frontend.

*2.* Web Application (TypeScript) receives the request and persists the user information in the [TODO: Database Name/Type].

*3.* When the User requests their history, the Web Application queries the [TODO: Database Name/Type].

*4.* The Web Application calculates metrics (games played, win/loss ratio) and returns them to the Web Frontend.


=== Human vs Computer Match 
This scenario references the high-level requirement: _Classic version of Game Y, player-vs-machine mode._ 
It covers the logic when a human player makes a move on the board.

* _<insert sequence diagram of the scenario described>_

*1.* User selects a position on the board via the Web Frontend.

*2.* Web Application (TypeScript) sends a JSON message in YEN notation to the Rust Module to verify the move.

*3.* Rust Module verifies if the match has been won or if the move is valid.

*4.* Rust Module returns the result (Move valid/Match won/Match continues) to the Web Application.

*5.* Web Application updates the game state in the [TODO: Database Name/Type] and reflects the new state in the Web Frontend.


=== Computer Strategy Execution 
This scenario references the high-level requirement: _The game against the computer must implement more than one strategy._ 
It describes how the system suggests of executes a move for the computer.

* _<insert sequence diagram of the scenario described>_

*1.* Web Application (TypeScript) triggers a request for a computer move based on the user-selected difficulty/strategy.

*2.* The request is sent to the Rust Module containing the current board state in YEN notation.

*3.* Rust Module invokes the selected strategy algorithm to calculate the next move.

*4.* Rust Module suggests the next move via its Web Service Interface.

*5.* Web Application receives the move, updates the board, and notifies the User.


=== External Bot Interaction
This scenario references the high-level requirement: _API will enable a bot to play... a 'play' method will be exposed._ 
It describes the interaction of an external bot with the YOVI system.

* _<insert sequence diagram of the scenario described>_

*1.* External Bot calls the 'play' method on the External API (Web Application).

*2.* The request includes a 'position' parameter and the board state in YEN notation.

*3.* Web Application forwards the state to the Rust Module for validation and win-condition checking.

*4.* Rust Module returns the updated state/result to the Web Application.

*5.* Web Application returns the next move to the External Bot using YEN notation.


=== Persistence and State Management
This scenario references the high-level requirement: _WebApp accessing the database._ 
It describes the basic data flow required for the first project milestone.

* _<insert sequence diagram of the scenario described>_

*1.* The Web Application receives a game-related action.

*2.* The Web Application establishes a connection to the [TODO: Database Technology].

*3.* The Web Application performs a CRUD operation (Create/Read/Update/Delete) to ensure game data is not lost between sessions.

*4.* The [TODO: Database Technology] confirms the transaction, allowing the WebApp to proceed with the runtime logic.
