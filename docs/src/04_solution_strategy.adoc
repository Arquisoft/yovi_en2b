== Solution Strategy

The architecture of the YOVI system follows a modular client/server approach that separates the user interface from backend services and the core game engine. This strategy supports maintainability and interoperability by keeping clear boundaries between UI, user management, and game logic.
The system exposes public APIs for user management and game interaction, while the Rust game engine remains internal and focused on validation and bot move computation.

=== Technology decisions

The web client is implemented in TypeScript to enable fast development of an interactive UI using modern web frameworks.
Backend services are implemented as HTTP APIs, and the game engine is implemented in Rust for performance and memory safety when running validation and search-based bot strategies.
Inter-service communication uses JSON and the YEN notation as the game-state contract.

=== Quality Goal Realization

Correctness and reliability are improved by enforcing game rules and validating YEN/JSON game states in the Rust engine.
Usability is addressed through a simple web-based flow (register/login/start game) and a clear UI.
Performance is addressed by using a compiled Rust engine for the computationally intensive bot logic and by keeping service calls bounded (timeouts) to avoid hanging requests.
Maintainability is supported by the separation into services (webapp-backend, users, gamey) and stable API contracts between them.
Security is handled through JWT-based authentication and role-based authorization (player/admin) for protected operations.

=== Organizational decisions

The system is developed by a four-member team with shared responsibilities across the stack. Version control and issue tracking support collaborative work and code quality through reviews and automated checks.
