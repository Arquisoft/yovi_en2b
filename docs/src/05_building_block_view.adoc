== Building Block View


ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes, interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations, data structures, ...) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, ...)

This view is mandatory for every architecture documentation.
In analogy to a house this is the _floor plan_.

.Motivation
Maintain an overview of your source code by making its structure understandable through
abstraction.

This allows you to communicate with your stakeholder on an abstract level without disclosing implementation details.

.Form
The building block view is a hierarchical collection of black boxes and white boxes
(see figure below) and their descriptions.

image::05_building_blocks-EN.png["Hierarchy of building blocks"]

*Level 1* is the white box description of the overall system together with black
box descriptions of all contained building blocks.

*Level 2* zooms into some building blocks of level 1.
Thus it contains the white box description of selected building blocks of level 1, together with black box descriptions of their internal building blocks.

*Level 3* zooms into selected building blocks of level 2, and so on.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-5/[Building Block View] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Whitebox Overall System

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you describe the decomposition of the overall system using the following white box template. It contains

 * an overview diagram
 * a motivation for the decomposition
 * black box descriptions of the contained building blocks. For these we offer you alternatives:

   ** use _one_ table for a short and pragmatic overview of all contained building blocks and their interfaces
   ** use a list of black box descriptions of the building blocks according to the black box template (see below).
   Depending on your choice of tool this list could be sub-chapters (in text files), sub-pages (in a Wiki) or nested elements (in a modeling tool).


 * (optional:) important interfaces, that are not explained in the black box templates of a building block, but are very important for understanding the white box.
Since there are so many ways to specify interfaces why do not provide a specific template for them.
 In the worst case you have to specify and describe syntax, semantics, protocols, error handling,
 restrictions, versions, qualities, necessary compatibilities and many things more.
In the best case you will get away with examples or simple signatures.

We applied *functional decomposition* to separate responsibilities within the YOVI system:

| Building Block | Description

| Web Frontend
| Browser-based TypeScript application. Renders the Y game board, handles user interaction, displays match history and statistics, and communicates with the Backend API using REST.

| Backend API
| Central application logic implemented in Node/TypeScript. Provides endpoints for authentication, user management, match flow, statistics, and the public Bot API. Manages requests to the Rust Engine using JSON/YEN.

| Rust Engine
| Rust service responsible for validating game states and computing the next move. Uses YEN notation for board representation and exposes a minimal JSON-based web service interface to the Backend API.

| Database
| Persistent storage containing users, match records, statistics, and historical data. Accessed exclusively through repository components in the Backend API.

| Player (external)
| Human user interacting with the system through the Web Frontend to play matches, manage their account, and review their statistics.

| External Bots (external)
| Automated agents consuming the public Bot API. Bots send board positions in YEN format and receive suggested moves from the system.

****
Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from level 1 as white boxes.

You have to decide which building blocks of your system are important enough to justify such a detailed description.
Please prefer relevance over completeness. Specify important, surprising, risky, complex or volatile building blocks.
Leave out normal, simple, boring or standardized parts of your system

| Building Block | Description

| Routes
| Handles all HTTP requests entering the Backend API. Delegates user‑related requests to *UserService* and game‑related requests (match flow, play actions) to *MatchService*.

| UserService
| Contains business logic related to user operations (authentication, profile management, statistics). Interacts with *UserRepository* to access persistent user data.

| MatchService
| Encapsulates all game workflow logic: creating matches, updating board states, preparing YEN structures, and coordinating validation and next‑move computations. Uses *YENAdapter* for conversions and *RustClient* for game logic execution.

| YENAdapter
| Converts data structures between internal board representation and **YEN notation**. Ensures serialization and parsing for communication with the Rust module.

| RustClient
| HTTP client responsible for invoking the Rust Engine service. Sends board state in JSON/YEN format to request validation or next‑move suggestions.

| UserRepository
| Persistence component managing user data (create, read, update, delete). Accessed exclusively via *UserService*.

| MatchRepository
| Persistence component managing match records (create, read, update, delete). Accessed exclusively via *MatchService*.
