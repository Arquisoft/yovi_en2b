== Context and Scope


ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Context and scope - as the name suggests - delimits your system (i.e. your scope) from all its communication partners
(neighboring systems and users, i.e. the context of your system). It thereby specifies the external interfaces.

If necessary, differentiate the business context (domain specific inputs and outputs) from the technical context (channels, protocols, hardware).

.Motivation
The domain interfaces and technical interfaces to communication partners are among your system's most critical aspects. Make sure that you completely understand them.

.Form
Various options:

* Context diagrams
* Lists of communication partners and their interfaces.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-3/[Context and Scope] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Business Context

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Specification of *all* communication partners (users, IT-systems, ...) with explanations of domain specific inputs and outputs or interfaces.
Optionally you can add domain specific formats or communication protocols.

.Motivation
All stakeholders should understand which data are exchanged with the environment of the system.

.Form
All kinds of diagrams that show the system as a black box and specify the domain interfaces to communication partners.

Alternatively (or additionally) you can use a table.
The title of the table is the name of your system, the three columns contain the name of the communication partner, the inputs, and the outputs.

The business context defines the external actors and how they interact with the YOVI system. The system handles user management, Y game logic, and the game interface for both humans and machines.

.Communication Partners
[options="header",cols="1,2,2"]
|===
| Communication Partner | Inputs | Outputs

| Human Player
| Registration/Login, board movement commands, game configuration
| Visual interface (UI), game state, personal history

| Bot API (External)
| Game requests with board state in YEN format
| Response with the next move calculated by the engine

| Administrator
| Service status queries and metrics
| System availability and performance reports
|===

==== Domain Interfaces

* *Web UI:* React-based interface for end-user interaction.
* *Bot API:* REST endpoint that allows external systems to play against the server logic using JSON/YEN format.

=== Technical Context

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Technical interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking your system to its environment. In addition a mapping of domain specific input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation which I/O uses which channel.

.Motivation
Many stakeholders make architectural decision based on the technical interfaces between the system and its context. Especially infrastructure or hardware designers decide these technical interfaces.

.Form
E.g. UML deployment diagram describing channels to neighboring systems,
together with a mapping table showing the relationships between channels and input/output.

The technical context describes the protocols and communication channels between the three main services and external systems.

==== Technical Interfaces and Channels

.Technical Interfaces and Channels
[options="header",cols="1,1,3"]
|===
| Interface | Channel / Protocol | Description

| Frontend ↔ Webapp
| HTTPS / JSON
| The React application (Vite) communicates with the Node.js backend through REST calls

| Webapp ↔ Gamey
| HTTP / JSON (YEN)
| The Node.js service delegates heavy logic and game validation to the Rust engine

| Webapp ↔ Users
| HTTP / REST
| Internal communication to validate sessions (JWT) and retrieve profiles

| Users ↔ MongoDB
| MongoDB Wire Protocol
| Persistence of user data, credentials, and audit logs

| Monitoring ↔ All
| HTTP / Metrics
| The monitoring module collects health check status from each service
|===

==== Mapping of Inputs/Outputs to Channels

. *Access Management:* Login requests are processed in the Users service, which verifies against MongoDB and returns a JWT.
. *Move Processing:* The game flow travels from Frontend → Webapp (Node) → Gamey (Rust), where the AI algorithm or validation is applied.
. *Persistence:* Only the Users service (and optionally Webapp for history) has direct access to the database to ensure data integrity.
